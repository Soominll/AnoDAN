# AnoDAN
### Anomalous gene detection using generative adversarial networks and graph neural networks for overcoming drug resistance

This repository provides relevant codes and data to find a combinatorial drug target using our framework called AnoDAN.

### Key features
AnoDAN can detect genes primarily responsible for the resistance.
combines GAN and GNN to identify genes that can overcome drug resistance and to unravel the underlying mechanisms by incorporating pathway information. It can also accurately reproduce the distribution of gene expressions in the sensitive cell lines and identify anomalous genes in the resistant cell lines. Furthermore, AnoDAN can incorporate datasets with graphical structures using the biological pathway information of the genes to discover hidden mechanisms as well as target genes for overcoming the resistance.
